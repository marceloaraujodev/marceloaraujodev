        <p>
          Hi thanks for your interest in my portfolio. This is a about me
          section so lets try not to be to long. I&apos;ve had a few different
          careers over the years. I&apos;m a former professional surfer, I
          competed in the world qualifying series from 2001 until 2008.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In the middle of 2008 I started a online business reselling products
          that I imported from china on ebay and amazon. In 2012 I started
          working with photography, I&apos;ve started with portraits then
          shooting behind the scenes of movies and then moved into fashion
          photography.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In the middle of 2023 I started studing front and backend development.
          I always had a strong interested in coding since I made my first
          website as a portfolio for my surfing career back in 2002. I used to
          stay all night long researching on google to fix small bugs on my html
          code.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I had a friend that was a hacker, I used to ask him for some
          tips on how to fix my code and he would always send me links of the
          documentation. It was a lot of fun and sleepless nights. I&apos;m
          looking for a full stack developer job. I&apos;m very focus, driven
          and have a strong mindset to get things done and problems solved.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
